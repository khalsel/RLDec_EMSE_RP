# Artifacts Package
This git repository includes all the code and data to validate the results of our paper titled "Extracting Microservices from Monolithic Systems using Deep Reinforcement Learning‚Äù which has been submitted the Empirical Software Engineering journal.

The repository provides :
* The detailed results achieved by our proposed approach and the baselines we compare with including the decomposition that they generated.
* The code used to generate the figures and tables in the paper and analyze the results.
* The figures showcased in the paper.
* A graph visualization of the examples analyzed in Research Question 3.
* names and ids of PetClinic-microservices' classes.
* The hyperparameters used for training the model

Description of the structure of the repository:
